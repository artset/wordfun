On Saturday and Sunday, he felt the sweet lightness of being rise up to him out of the
depths of the future. On Monday, he was hit by a weight the likes of which he had never
known. The tons of steel of the Russian tanks were nothing compared with it. For there
is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the
pain one feels with someone, for someone, a pain intensified by the imagination and
prolonged by a hundred echoes. He kept warning himself not to give in to compassion, and compassion listened with
bowed head and a seemingly guilty conscience. Compassion knew it was being
presumptuous, yet it quietly stood its ground, and on the fifth day after her departure
Tomas informed the director of his hospital (the man who had phoned him daily in
Prague after the Russian invasion) that he had to return at once. He was ashamed. He
knew that the move would appear irresponsible, inexcusable to the man. He thought to
unbosom himself and tell him the story of Tereza and the letter she had left on the table
for him. But in the end he did not. From the Swiss doctor's point of view Tereza's move
could only appear hysterical and abhorrent. And Tomas refused to allow anyone an
opportunity to think ill of her. The director of the hospital was in fact offended. Tomas
shrugged his shoulders and said, Es muss sein. Es muss sein.
