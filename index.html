        Hey! I'm glad you're here. I made these mini projects at Hack@Brown and a literary
        arts class I took that are a mix of programmatic literary pieces!

        <div class="sub"><a href="https://shinelikastar.github.io/coloringbooks/">coloringbooks</a></div>
        data visualization project built with Zach Baytosh, Star Su, and Bethany Hung that explores how literature
        can be translated into colors. (special thanks to word2vec)

        <div class="sub"><a href="/wordfun/type">type</a></div>
        my poem generator that uses markov chains to show the preservation of literary voice, emphasized
        by different type. (shout out to datamuse and rita)

        <div class="sub"><a href="/wordfun/indulge">indulge</a></div>
        a poem about decadence authored by bonappetit, dorian gray, some neural nets, and me

        <div class="sub"><a href="/wordfun/tempus">tempus</a></div>
        a fridge magnet generator where you can revise Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and see your revisions
        of each text by temperature. (thanks again, rita, and the jquery library!)

        <div class="sub"><a href="https://issuu.com/katherinesang/docs/lightweight">lightweight</a></div>
        bite-sized data visualization of the lightness of text through a zine. (bless numpy for letting
        me do that number witchcraft and d3 for automating my visualizations)
